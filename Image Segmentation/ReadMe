Objective
Semantic image segmentation refers to the process of labelling each pixel of an image with a corresponding class of what is being represented.The 4-channel training mask images contains multi-class segmentations (road, buildings, vegetation,Green farms,Dry farms, barren land, water body and other). Your task is to extract the vegetation class, which has a pixel density (255, 201, 0, 255). Each mask contains vegetation. Masks are not allowed to overlap (no pixel belongs to two masks)

Input
There are zip files containing the satellite images and the respective masks. These images are of size 2048x1948. It is recommended to cut these images into parts of 512x512 (total: 16) before training the model. There are 441 images in the train set and 50 images in the test set.
